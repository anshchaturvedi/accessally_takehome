Firstly, thanks so much for the opportunity to participate in the takehome! Doing it in 3 hours was a little challenging but very fun at the same time :)

Just for your ease, I wanted to give a quick explanation of how I've written my code. Each of `blood_distribution.py` and `favourite_times.py` have a test harness (that I yanked from my other projects) which runs the `.in` files and compares the result to the `.out` files. Running either:
```python
python blood_distribution.py
# or
python favourite_times.py
```
will run the entire given test suite, and all of them will pass :) You can also see the actual implementations in the functions `favourite_times()` and `blood_distribution()` respectively.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to email me at `ansh.chaturvedi@uwaterloo.ca`, and I hope to get the chance to chat with you soon!
